## How to control the game
Key `W`: Move the ship upwards.  
Key `A`: Move the ship left.  
Key `S`: Move the ship downwards.  
Key `D`: Move the ship right.  
Key `E`: Open store.  
Key `T`: Activate teleport mode (only works if you have teleports)  
Key `ESC`: Pause the game.  
Key `ALT+F4`: Forces exit the game. (Only works with Windows and most Linux distros like Ubuntu)  
Key `CTRL+Q`: Forces exit the game. (Only works with macOS and some Linux distros like PearOSX)  
> Note: `CTRL` is `CMD` for Apple keyboards!  

## Tips
* When the launcher stops responding spam click the window, when you get a popup select "stop this program" or something similar.  
  Then create a folder named **temp** in the folder of the launcher updater, and in the folder **game** of the launcher updater.  
  I will fix this as soon as possible, you will know if it is gone. (may be I will show that in the log)
* Press ESC in the game to pause it (like in Minecraft)
